To determine the prevalence of hypoxaemia in children aged under 5 years suffering acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the risk factors for hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association of hypoxaemia with an increased risk of dying in children of the same age. Systematic review of the published literature. Out-patient clinics, emergency departments and hospitalisation wards in 23 health centres from 10 countries. Cohort studies reporting the frequency of hypoxaemia in children under 5 years of age with ALRI, and the association between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Prevalence of hypoxaemia measured in children with ARI and relative risks for the association between the severity of illness and the frequency of hypoxaemia, and between hypoxaemia and the risk of dying. Seventeen published studies were found that included 4,021 children under 5 with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and reported the prevalence of hypoxaemia. Out-patient children and those with a clinical diagnosis of upper ARI had a low risk of hypoxaemia (pooled estimate of 6% to 9%). The prevalence increased to 31% and to 43% in patients in emergency departments and in cases with clinical pneumonia, respectively, and it was even higher among hospitalised children (47%) and in those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia (72%). The cumulated data also suggest that hypoxaemia is more frequent in children living at high altitude. Three papers reported an association between hypoxaemia and death, with relative risks varying between 1.4 and 4.6. Papers describing predictors of hypoxaemia have focused on clinical signs for detecting hypoxaemia rather than on identifying risk factors for developing this complication. Hypoxaemia is a common and potentially lethal complication of ALRI in children under 5, particularly among those with severe disease and those living at high altitude. Given the observed high prevalence of hypoxaemia and its likely association with increased mortality, efforts should be made to improve the detection of hypoxaemia and to provide oxygen earlier to more children with severe ALRI.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8290598291, 'avg_line_length': 1111.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1147244806, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9518523216, 'max_line_length': 2144, 'num_words': 406, 'perplexity': 746.9, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1830859199, 'text_len': 2223, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0352644836}",1.4606482302595758e+19

Hypoxaemia is a common complication of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children. In most developing countries, where the majority of deaths from pneumonia occur, facilities for early detection of hypoxaemia are lacking and oxygen is in short supply. This review examines the usefulness of different clinical signs and symptoms in the prediction of hypoxaemia associated with acute respiratory infections in children. Several respiratory signs were found to be associated with hypoxaemia. These include very fast breathing (with a respiratory rate of more than 60 or 70 breaths per minute), cyanosis, grunting, nasal flaring, chest retractions, head nodding and auscultatory signs, as well as signs of general depression of the child, such as inability to feed or lethargy. The sensitivity and specificity of these signs, as described in the reviewed studies, is presented, and combination rules are discussed. Through appropriate combination of several physical signs, which can be used by peripheral health workers and be taught to mothers, it is possible to predict hypoxaemia in children with acute respiratory tract infections with reasonable accuracy.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8334636435, 'avg_line_length': 639.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0858267717, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9608361721, 'max_line_length': 1168, 'num_words': 223, 'perplexity': 253.9, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1696637998, 'text_len': 1279, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.503772719330205e+19

To investigate the severity and duration of hypoxaemia in 703 children with severe or very severe pneumonia presenting to Goroka Hospital in the Papua New Guinea highlands; to study the predictive value of clinical signs for the severity of hypoxaemia, the predictive value of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other variables for mortality. Prospective evaluation of children with severe or very severe pneumonia. SpO2 was measured at the time of presentation and every day until hypoxaemia resolved. Children with a SpO2 less than 85% received supplemental oxygen. By comparing with a retrospective control group for whom oxygen administration was guided by clinical signs, we evaluated whether there was a survival advantage from using a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry. We determined normal values for oxygen saturation in children living in the highlands. In 151 well, normal highland children, the mean SpO2 was 95.7% (SD 2.7%). The median SpO2 among children with severe or very severe pneumonia was 70% (56-77); 376 (53.5%) had moderate hypoxaemia (SpO2 70-84%); 202 (28.7%) had severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 50-69%); and 125 (17.8%) had very severe hypoxaemia (SpO2 < 50%). Longer duration of cough or the presence of hepatomegaly or cyanosis predicted more severe degrees of hypoxaemia. After 10, 20 and 30 days from the beginning of treatment, respectively 102 (14.5%), 38 (5.4%) and 19 (2.7%) of children had persistent hypoxaemia; 46 children (6.5%) died. Predictors of death were low SpO2 on presentation, severe malnutrition, measles and history of cough for more than 7 days. The mortality risk ratio between the 703 children managed whose oxygen administration was guided by the use of pulse oximetry and the retrospective control group who received supplemental oxygen based on clinical signs was 0.65 (95%CI 0.41-1.02, two-sided Fisher's exact test, P = 0.07). There is a need to increase the availability of supplemental oxygen in smaller health facilities in developing countries, and to train health workers to recognise the clinical signs and risk factors for hypoxaemia. In moderate sized hospitals a protocol for the administration of oxygen based on pulse oximetry may improve survival.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8044041451, 'avg_line_length': 1158.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0827915041, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9488483667, 'max_line_length': 2250, 'num_words': 422, 'perplexity': 1639.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.23791019, 'text_len': 2316, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.01937046}",2.74976621592413e+18

Oxygen is one of the essential medical supplies in any hospital setting. However, in some rural African settings without regular electricity and with logistical problems in the transport of oxygen cylinders, the delivery of oxygen can be difficult. This paper compares the costs incurred using oxygen cylinders with a solar operated oxygen concentrator in a rural Gambian setting. The paper shows that a solar operated system has a high capital investment initially, but that running costs and maintenance are minimal. The system becomes cost effective if a rural hospital needs more than 6 treatment days (1 l/min) of oxygen per month and can be considered in a setting where 6 hours of sunlight per day can be guaranteed.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8223938224, 'avg_line_length': 388.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0677083333, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.939884901, 'max_line_length': 723, 'num_words': 135, 'perplexity': 418.4, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1814671815, 'text_len': 777, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",7.673824521730311e+18

Oxygen administration is one of the most important modalities of therapy for a patient with hypoxaemia to prevent death. This review summarises the methods of oxygen delivery applicable in small hospitals in developing countries, and evaluates information about their safety and efficacy. The following criteria were considered: cost and availability, efficiency/oxygen concentration achieved, tolerability/comfort of the method, requirement of humidification, demand for nursing care, and safety of the method and complications. In summary, it is concluded that all low-flow methods, i.e., nasopharyngeal catheters, nasal catheters and prongs, are effective in the oxygenation of sick children with severe pneumonia or bronchiolitis. Nasal prongs are the safest method of oxygen delivery, but nasopharyngeal catheters and nasal catheters are more easily available and less expensive. However, if they are used, they need close supervision to avoid serious complications.

An open, randomised trial. Patients with previously untreated, sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients received amikacin 5 mg/kg (12 patients), 10 mg/kg (13 patients) or 15 mg/kg (15 patients), isoniazid 6 mg/kg (9 patients) or no drug (10 patients). The rate of decrease in log viable colony forming units of Mycobacterium tuberculosis per ml of sputum per day during the first 2 days of treatment with amikacin 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg was 0.041 (SD 0.100), 0.045 (SD 0.144) and 0.052 (SD 0.096), respectively, 0.515 (SD 0.173) in the patients receiving isoniazid 6 mg/kg, and 0.041 (SD 0.113) in those receiving no drug.

It is generally accepted that qualitative drug susceptibility tests established and validated for Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not applicable to opportunist (non-tuberculous) mycobacteria.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination may provide better correlation with predicted clinical response than the conventional MR results. To determine the relationship between quantitative in vitro sensitivity results for opportunist mycobacteria and their in vivo response to treatment.

Only one significant association was found; in vitro resistance to ethambutol correlated with treatment failure for M. malmoense infections (P = 0.027).

This study tested a new high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scoring method for asbestos-induced parenchymal changes in the lung. HRCT scans of 602 asbestos-exposed workers and 49 referents were reviewed by 3 radiologists. Structured forms were filled out for a semiquantitative HRCT fibrosis score based on several specified parenchymal abnormalities scored separately. Observer agreement was studied with the use of the quadratic-weighted kappa (kappaqw). The HRCT fibrosis score (from 0 to V with definitions and index images given retrospectively) was compared with the radiographic classification of the International Labour Office (ILO) for the same patients. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to compare the tests for diagnosing asbestosis. Good inter- and intraobserver agreements were achieved (kappaqw = 0.64 and 0.72, respectively) as regards the HRCT fibrosis score. All the specified computed tomography findings explained 86% of the variance in the HRCT fibrosis score. Age and occupational group were significant predictors of fibrosis. The area under the ROC curve was significantly greater for the HRCT fibrosis score (0.89) than for the ILO radiographic classification (0.76). The sensitivity (70%) and specificity (91%) of the HRCT fibrosis score (classes I/II-V representing asbestosis) were better than those of the classification published by the International Labour Office (51% and 89%, respectively, score > or = 1/0 representing asbestosis). The examined HRCT scoring method proved to be a simple, reliable, and reproducible method for classifying lung fibrosis and diagnosing asbestosis also in large populations with occupational disease, and it would be possible to use it as a part of an international classification.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8245243129, 'avg_line_length': 946.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.09771641, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9490843415, 'max_line_length': 1780, 'num_words': 352, 'perplexity': 649.0, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1918604651, 'text_len': 1892, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.0586982092119407e+19

A study was conducted to investigate cancer risks in a cohort of pulp and paper workers. All male workers with > or =1 years of employment in 14 pulp and paper mills in 1950-1992 were studied. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were used to compare the cancer incidence of the cohort with that of the Canadian male population. Record linkage with the National Cancer Registry was performed using the generalized iterative record linkage method. Altogether 1756 cancer cases were observed in the entire cohort. For > or =15 years of work, the entire cohort had significantly increased SIR values for pleural and prostate cancer and skin melanoma; there was also a significantly increased risk for skin melanoma among workers in the kraft process only, rectal cancer among workers in the sulfite process only, and stomach and prostate cancer and all leukemias combined among workers in both the kraft and sulfite processes. A separate analysis comparing workers in pulping and papermaking with those in the pulping process only did not reveal any difference in cancer risk and hence did not modify the results. The SIR values for skin melanoma were not significantly increased in a comparison using the British Columbia male population. Nine of 10 pleural cancers were mesotheliomas, which likely reflect past asbestos exposure. The results suggest that long-term work in the pulp and paper industry is associated with excess risks of prostate and stomach cancers and all leukemias for work in both kraft and sulfite processes and of rectal cancer for work in the sulfite process only.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8244137102, 'avg_line_length': 831.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0834340992, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9697978497, 'max_line_length': 1584, 'num_words': 306, 'perplexity': 520.7, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1870114251, 'text_len': 1663, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",9.97904483810622e+18

This study attempted to determine the level of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes of victims of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia.

The victims suffered from severe psychoemotional stress but were otherwise healthy. All the samples were taken 2 to 3 weeks after the earthquake. All the subjects were lifetime nonsmokers. The cells were scored blind as to the exposure status. The subjects exposed to the earthquake had a higher proportion of cells with chromosome aberrations [3.1 (SD 2.1)%] than the referents [1.7 (SD 1.3)%, P-value for the difference 0.0009]. The difference persisted when the values were adjusted for age and gender [relative risk (RR) 1.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4-2.5]. The difference was present for double breaks (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.6-6.4), but not for single breaks (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.7). The exposed subjects also had a lower percentage of cells with 46 chromosomes (P=0.03) than the referents. This study suggests an increase in chromosome aberrations in the lymphocytes of victims of a severe earthquake as compared with the levels of referents. If not due to bias or confounding, the difference may reflect the effect of either environmental exposures related to the earthquake or severe psychogenic stress. The levels of chromosome aberrations found among the earthquake victims in this study are comparable with those found in prospective studies of long-term cancer risk.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8031212485, 'avg_line_length': 833.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1098370549, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9577499628, 'max_line_length': 1580, 'num_words': 313, 'perplexity': 998.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2316926771, 'text_len': 1666, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.7504973337225597e+19

The precision of mean exposure to pushing was examined in 2 occupational groups using various combinations of the number of workers and measurements per worker. The frequency and duration of pushing of the 2 occupational groups was assessed using onsite observation. All data were divided into successive periods of 30 minutes of observation. The precision of the group mean exposure to pushing was expressed by 90% confidence intervals obtained by bootstrapping. The effect on the confidence interval of varying numbers of workers and numbers of periods per worker was examined. For both occupational groups there was little precision to be gained when >10 workers were observed. Within the maximum number of workers used in the bootstrap simulations, it appeared that, beyond 10 workers, the confidence intervals decreased by <5% for every worker that was added, when each worker was observed at least 8 periods of 30 minutes. If workers were observed exactly 4 periods of 30 minutes per worker, an additional 4 workers were required to compensate for the loss of precision. An unbalanced strategy with approximately 8 periods of 30 minutes per worker hardly decreased the precision of the group mean, however. The precision of the group-based mean exposure to pushing is influenced by the number of workers observed and by the number of repeated measurements per worker. In the planning of measurement strategies, it is advisable to account for possible sources of variance in advance and to assess the exposure variability.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8287841191, 'avg_line_length': 806.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0917030568, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9733040333, 'max_line_length': 1527, 'num_words': 268, 'perplexity': 659.0, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1842431762, 'text_len': 1612, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.4841000055286444e+19

Urine samples from occupationally exposed workers were analyzed for the levels of urinary metabolites of HHPA and MHHPA, and the levels were used as the index of exposure. In addition, blood samples were obtained from the same persons, and the levels of TPPA were determined. Reversed solid phase extraction, derivatization using pentafluorobenzyl bromide, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in the negative ion chemical ionization mode were used to quantify the exposure. To assess the suitability of TPPA as a biomarker of exposure to the anhydrides, the TPPA levels were correlated to urinary metabolite levels and hemoglobin (Hb) adducts. The toxicokinetics of TPPA were also studied to determine the elimination half-time of the adducts. The levels of TPPA correlated exceptionally well with the metabolite levels in the urine sampled repeatedly, giving r=0.97 for HHPA and r=0.92 for MHHPA. The TPPA of HHPA correlated highly with the Hb adducts with r=0.86. There were also good correlations between single urinary determinations and the TPPA levels (r(s)=0.71 and 0.81, respectively, for HHPA and MHHPA). The in vivo decay of TPPA gave an elimination half-time of 22 days for HHPA and 24 days for MHHPA. TPPA levels of HHPA and MHHPA are excellent biomarkers of long-term exposure to anhydrides.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8236321304, 'avg_line_length': 859.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0766530135, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9607389569, 'max_line_length': 1581, 'num_words': 392, 'perplexity': 333.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1880093132, 'text_len': 1718, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",8.459116900426428e+18

This study compared the separate effects produced by two complementary stress models--the job demand-control model and the effort-reward imbalance model--on depression among employees threatened by job loss. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to examine these associations among 190 male and female employees who responded to a self-administered questionnaire in a small Japanese plant with economic hardship. The employees were engaged in 2 job types--direct assembly line and indirect supportive tasks--and the latter was threatened by job loss because of downsizing. Independent variables were measured by the Japanese versions of Karasek's demand-control questionnaire and Siegrist's effort-reward imbalance questionnaire. Depression was assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The employees with indirect supportive tasks (target for downsizing) were more likely to have depressive symptoms than direct assembly-line workers. Job strain, a combination of high demand and low control at work, was more frequent among the latter, while the combination of high effort and low reward was more frequent among the former. After adjustment for work environment factors, low control [odds ratio (OR) 4.7], effort reward imbalance (OR 4.1), and overcommitment (the person characteristic included in the effort-reward imbalance model) (OR 2.6) were independently related to depression. There is some indication that these effects were particularly strong in the subgroup suffering from potential job loss. This study confirms that the 2 job stress models identify different aspects of stressful job conditions. Moreover, effort-reward imbalance and low control at work are both associated with symptoms of depression.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8321052632, 'avg_line_length': 950.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0803807509, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9700472355, 'max_line_length': 1745, 'num_words': 314, 'perplexity': 738.0, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1736842105, 'text_len': 1900, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",6.74109763603564e+18

The effect of introducing regularity, few consecutive night shifts, more weekends off, and only 2 different types of shifts (day-evening or day-night) into shift scheduling on biomarkers of heart disease was studied. Ergonomic shift criteria were introduced in a quasi-experimental controlled intervention in 4 hospital wards. Six wards participated as controls. Altogether 101 nurses and nurses' aides were followed for 6 months with measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The intervention led to more regular schedules and more staff having 2 shifts in 2 of the intervention wards 1 year after the intervention. The schedules among the controls became less regular and less predictable. The number of consecutive night shifts remained unchanged. After 6 months the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level had increased in the intervention group, and the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the  cholesterol ratio had decreased. Regardless of the intervention, changes in regularity were associated with the triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels and also with the  cholesterol ratio. More ergonomic changes were associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels, a lower  cholesterol ratio, and higher HDL cholesterol levels. Increased ergonomic scheduling was possible. Lipids and lipoproteins changed as predicted, both when the changes were assessed in respect to the changes in schedules that resulted from the intervention and the changes that occurred regardless of the intervention.

Processing tasks measure a child's ability to process and manipulate language rather than tap previous linguistic knowledge. The present study utilized 40 subjects between the ages of 7;0 and 7;3 in the following equal groupings: White normal language, White language impaired, African American normal language, African American language impaired. The subjects were administered the Test of Language Development-2P (TOLD-2P), the Nonword Repetition Task (NRT), and the Competing Language Processing Task (CLPT). Results indicated that all three measures differentiated normal-language and language-impaired subjects from one another.

Based on long-term experience this paper aims to discuss the various complexes regarding the urethral pressure profilometry. The significance of the urethral closure function for urinary continence and the urodynamic relevance of active and passive pressure transmission are described. In addition, clinical implications in terms of therapeutic strategies to treat urinary stress incontinence with regards to a low urethral pressure profile are presented.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.849197861, 'avg_line_length': 467.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1079913607, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9021489024, 'max_line_length': 881, 'num_words': 167, 'perplexity': 281.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.150802139, 'text_len': 935, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.3616250005208195e+19

The urethral wall contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle. Both layers can develop spontaneous tone, and contract further or relax in response to excitatory or inhibitory stimuli. In the pig the cells do not generate action potentials, and the membranes possess L-type calcium channels and a variety of potassium channels which may modulate the membrane potential and tone. The importance of these layers in generating the urethral pressure is not well understood in the human, but it seems likely that the circular smooth muscle is involved in generating urethral pressure in the pig.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8388489209, 'avg_line_length': 347.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0816326531, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.8928546309, 'max_line_length': 594, 'num_words': 115, 'perplexity': 306.7, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1611510791, 'text_len': 695, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.1707711415397929e+19

Urethral smooth muscle tension is one of the factors contributing to the maintenance of intraurethral pressure and to continence. This tension is controlled by nervous mechanisms involving a complex pattern of efferent and afferent signalling in parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic nerves, with resulting release of contraction- and relaxation-producing transmitters and mediators. Sympathetic activity, via release of NA and stimulation of urethral smooth muscle alpha1-ARs, is the main contraction-producing factor. Among the three high affinity alpha1-AR subtypes identified in molecular cloning and functional studies, the alpha1A subtype seems to predominate in both the male and female urethra. The physiological role of the urethral beta-adrenoceptors has not been established, and the importance of muscarinic receptors (and subtypes) for urethral function is presently unclear. Nitric oxide, produced by nitric oxide synthase within cholinergic nerves, seems to be the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter, but there is good evidence for the existence of other, as yet unidentified, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory messengers. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and carbon monoxide (CO) all relax urethral smooth muscle, and are potential candidates for the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic relaxation, but their roles for urethral function remain to be defined.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8408937035, 'avg_line_length': 738.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0715258856, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9114097357, 'max_line_length': 1415, 'num_words': 273, 'perplexity': 241.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1618144888, 'text_len': 1477, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.5106853615710011e+19
"{'pmid': 11409613, 'language': 'eng'}","Neural control of the urethra.
Coordination between the urinary bladder and the urethra is mediated by multiple reflex pathways organized in the brain and spinal cord. Some reflexes promote urine storage; whereas other reflexes facilitate voiding. During bladder filling, activation of mechanoreceptor afferent nerves in the bladder wall triggers firing in the cholinergic efferent pathways to the external urethral sphincter (EUS) and in sympathetic adrenergic pathways to the urethral smooth muscle. These storage reflexes are dependent upon interneuronal circuitry in the spinal cord. During voiding the spinal storage reflexes are inhibited by supraspinal mechanisms which originate in the pontine micturition center. Glutamatergic, serotonergic and alpha, adrenergic excitatory transmission as well as GABAergic/glycinergic inhibitory transmission have been implicated in the central control of sphincter reflexes. During voiding, a parasympathetic nitrergic inhibitory input to the urethral smooth is activated. This reflex mechanism which is triggered by bladder afferents persists in paraplegic rats and therefore must be mediated at least in part by spinal interneuronal circuitry. In female rats, the parasympathetic nitrergic pathway is prominent; but in male rats it is obscured by a dominant parasympathetic cholinergic excitatory input to the urethral smooth muscle. The function of the cholinergic pathway in voiding is uncertain. Stimulation of urethral afferents can also influence bladder activity. Contraction of the external urethral sphincter activates afferents that inhibit reflex bladder contractions; whereas infusion of fluid through the urethra facilitates bladder contractions. These reflexes are also organized in the spinal cord and presumably play a role in urine storage and elimination. Alterations in primitive bladder-to-urethra and urethra-to-bladder reflex mechanisms may contribute to neurogenic bladder dysfunction.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8490276356, 'avg_line_length': 977.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0719794344, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9000626802, 'max_line_length': 1923, 'num_words': 401, 'perplexity': 232.0, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1509723644, 'text_len': 1954, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.7355003168470958e+18

Our concepts of pathophysiology of stress urinary continence have been greatly shaped by developments in radiographic imaging. Simple radiographs with and without contrast initially revealed the importance of urethral descent in pathogenesis. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and real time ultrasonography are showing soft tissue detail within both a global pelvic and a local urethral context. Careful examination of these studies can extend our concepts of pathophysiology and lead us beyond existing paradigms. We propose a unified theory of stress incontinence based on our dynamic fastscan MRI and real time ultrasonograms of stress incontinence, incorporating known details of pelvic anatomy, sphincteric location and function. The hypothesis introduces the concept of a continence threshold at which the urethra is subjected simultaneously to both shearing and explusive forces. If these forces are sufficient to overcome urethral coaptation at threshold, leakage results. The model proposes an anatomical sequence of changes through which the incontinent urethra cycles between periods of rest and increased abdominal pressure, and suggests a way in which repeated episodes of prolpase and urethral traction by shearing forces exerted by the vagina on the urethra may contribute to the development of intrinsic sphincteric deficiency.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8485254692, 'avg_line_length': 746.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0674308833, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9098111987, 'max_line_length': 1357, 'num_words': 276, 'perplexity': 395.8, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1514745308, 'text_len': 1492, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",6.603080496754264e+18

We examined the burst swimming performance of two Antarctic fishes, Trematomus bernacchii and T. centronotus, at five temperatures between -1 degrees C and 10 degrees C. As Antarctic fishes are considered one of the most cold specialised and stenothermal of all ectotherms, we predicted they would possess a narrow thermal performance breadth for burst swimming and a correlative decrease in performance at high temperatures. Burst swimming was assessed by videotaping swimming sequences with a 50-Hz video camera and analysing the sequences frame-by-frame to determine maximum velocity, the distance moved throughout the initial 200 ms, and the time taken to reach maximum velocity. In contrast to our prediction, we found both species possessed a wide thermal performance breadth for burst swimming. Although maximum swimming velocity for both T. bernacchii and T. centronotus was significantly highest at 6 degrees C, maximum velocity at all other test temperatures was less than 20% lower. Thus, it appears that specialisation to a highly stable and cold environment is not necessarily associated with a narrow thermal performance breadth for burst swimming in Antarctic fish. We also examined the ability of the Antarctic fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki to acclimate their burst-swimming performance to different temperatures. We exposed P. borchgrevinki to either -1 degrees C or 4 degrees C for 4 weeks and tested their burst-swimming performance at four temperatures between -1 degrees C and 10 degrees C. Burst-swimming performance of Pagothenia borchgrevinki was unaffected by exposure to either -1 degrees C or 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. Maximum swimming velocity of both acclimation groups was thermally independent over the total temperature range of 1 degrees C to 10 degrees C. Therefore, the loss of any capacity to restructure the phenotype and an inability to thermally acclimate swimming performance appears to be associated with inhabiting a highly stable thermal environment.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8322179732, 'avg_line_length': 1046.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1108977436, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9435163736, 'max_line_length': 1992, 'num_words': 400, 'perplexity': 770.8, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1787762906, 'text_len': 2092, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0204603581}",1.500382157667583e+18

Ionic regulation by the gills of the freshwater-adapted Chinese crab, Eriocheir sinensis, was examined. The balance of uptake and loss of NaCl in crabs living in freshwater was established. Urine production was measured directly by cannulating the nephropores. Daily urinary loss of Na+ is equivalent to 16% of the haemolymph Na+ content and is substantially higher than that based on data from indirect measurements reported in the literature. Weight and area of anterior and posterior gills are proportional to body weight. The role of the gills in compensating urinary loss by uptake was determined by analysing changes in Na+ and Cl- concentrations in the external medium in which isolated perfused gills were suspended. In posterior gills, salt loss is quantitatively balanced by NaCl net uptake from an external concentration of 1.3 mmol l(-1) NaCl upwards. The transport constant (Kt) for half maximum saturation of net uptake and saturation of NaCl uptake are 1.5 mmol l(-1) and 4 mmol l(-1), respectively. In contrast to previous studies in which tracer fluxes or transepithelial short-circuit currents were determined, our method of direct ion determination shows that no net uptake of Na+ or Cl- occurs in posterior gills in the absence of the respective counter ion, or when uptake of one ion is blocked by a specific inhibitor.

Samples of flight and leg muscle tissue were taken from migratory garden warblers at three different stages of migration: (1) pre-flight: when birds face an extended flight phase within the next few days, (2) post-flight: when they have just completed an extended flight phase, and (3) recovery: when they are at the end of a stop-over period following an extended flight phase. The changes in body mass are closely related to the changes in flight (P<0.001) and leg muscle mass (P<0.001), suggesting that the skeletal muscles are involved in the protein metabolism associated with migratory flight. From pre- to post-flight, the flight and the leg muscle masses decrease by about 22%, but are restored to about 12% above the pre-flight masses during the recovery period. Biochemical analyses show that following flight a selective reduction occurred in the myofibrillar (contractile) component of the flight muscle (P<0.01). As this selective reduction accounts only for a minor part of the muscle mass changes, sarcoplasmic (non-contractile) and myofibrillar proteins of both the flight and leg muscle act as a protein source during long-distance migration. As a loss of leg muscle mass is additionally observed besides the loss in flight muscle mass, mass change seems not to be strictly associated with the mechanical power output requirements during flight. Whereas the specific content of sarcoplasmic proteins in the flight muscle is nearly twice as high as that in the leg muscle (P<0.001), the specific content of myofibrillar proteins differs only slightly (P < 0.05), being comparably low in both muscles.

The underlying mechanism for this depolarization was studied by applying the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Application of L-glutamate (1 mM) elicited an inward current that peaked at 8.1+/-0.7 nA (n = 73) at a holding potential of-50 mV. Both L- and D-aspartate also induced an inward current of almost the same amplitude as L-glutamate, whereas D-glutamate failed to induce an inward current. Glutamate receptor agonists, such as kainate, quisqualate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxazole-4-propionic acid, and N-methyl-D-aspartate, were ineffective in eliciting inward currents. The glutamate-induced inward current did not reverse even when the holding potential was set to +40 mV. The replacement of extracellular Na+ with choline+ eliminated the inward current. These results strongly suggest that the current induced by glutamate is mediated by a glutamate transporter rather than a glutamate receptor. We further examined the effects of 12 amino acid analogs which are known to be selective inhibitors of the mammalian excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) on the corpora allata transporter. From the effects of these inhibitors, we conclude that the glutamate transporter expressed in corpora allata cells of the cricket is similar to the high affinity glutamate transporters cloned from human brain, especially EAAT1 and EAAT3. Unlike mammalian transporters, however, serine-O-sulfate has the most potent action, suggesting the unique feature of the glutamate transporter expressed in the corpora allata.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.813990461, 'avg_line_length': 943.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1027689031, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9129479527, 'max_line_length': 1749, 'num_words': 374, 'perplexity': 393.3, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2019077901, 'text_len': 1887, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",6.997952127046099e+17

Both the total amount of pollen and the amount of free fatty acids in the endoperitrophic region and in the intestinal wall depend on the bee's age.

Forced feeding with triacylglycerol results in significantly higher levels of free fatty acids, especially in the endoperitrophic region, in 8-day-old bees and foragers.

At 14 weeks and 20 weeks post-hatch, corresponding to initial lengths of 30 mm and 44 mm respectively, fish were acclimated to 10 degrees C using a rate of cooling of 1 degrees C per day. A statistical model was used to compare the time course in the change of white muscle myofibrillar ATPase activity with temperature acclimation. The myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition of white muscle myofibrils was investigated using peptide mapping. A significant increase in myofibrillar ATPase activity was observed after 2-3 weeks in the 44 mm group, but not until 4-5 weeks in the 30 mm group. when they had reached 37 mm TL. The MHC banding pattern of 120 mm TL fish acclimated to 10 degrees C or 21 degrees C for a minimum of 6 weeks were distinct from each other. The MHC peptide map characteristic of 10-degrees C-acclimated fish was not observed in individuals less than 37 mm length.

During the denning period, black bears (Ursus americanus) are capable of enduring several months without food. At the same time, female bears that are pregnant or lactating have an added metabolic stress. Based on laboratory studies, much of the energy required to support metabolism and lactation during denning in black bears comes from lipid reserves. These lipid reserves are mobilized and the most metabolically active lipid fraction in the blood are nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Therefore, we hypothesized that plasma NEFAs would be higher in denning relative to active bears and in lactating relative to non-lactating female bears. We further hypothesized that in bears with elevated plasma NEFA levels, other lipid-related parameters (e.g., ketone bodies, albumin, cholesterol, lipase) would also be elevated in the plasma. Denning bears had significantly increased NEFA levels in all classes (saturates, monoenes, and polyenes). A doubling of plasma NEFA levels and a 33% increase in albumin, the plasma fatty acid binding protein, in denning bears, resulted in NEFA/albumin ratios that were higher in denning bears (4:1) compared to those of active bears (3:1). Bears became relatively ketonemic with a 17-fold increase in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels during the denning period. Plasma cholesterol approximately doubled and lipase was ten-fold lower in denning relative to active bears. These findings indicate a strong correlation between plasma lipid metabolites and the denning period in a wild population of black bears.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8224242424, 'avg_line_length': 825.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0731261426, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.933809638, 'max_line_length': 1540, 'num_words': 314, 'perplexity': 656.8, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1824242424, 'text_len': 1650, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.6625298918151463e+19

We compared whole-body concentrations of lactate, glucose, glycerol, and ATP in turtles chilled at 0 degrees C, -4 degrees C, or -6 degrees C for 5 days, or at 6 degrees C for 19 days. In a companion experiment, we measured metabolite concentrations in turtles exposed to a hypoxic environment for 1 day, 4 days, or 8 days. Supercooling and hypoxia exposure were both associated with an increase in concentrations of lactate and glucose and a decrease in glycerol concentrations (albeit no change in the ATP pool), suggesting that supercooling induces functional hypoxia.

The foramen of Panizza is located within the outflow tract of the crocodilian heart, between the left and right aortas. It has been suggested that the foramen of Panizza has a variable calibre, which could explain the profound changes in the distribution of flows and pressure profiles recorded in the right and left aortas. We investigated this possibility using a modified in-situ perfused heart preparation in combination with isolated strip preparations from the outflow tract. In the perfused heart preparation, bolus injections of adrenaline increased the resistance in the foramen of Panizza, indicating a decrease in its diameter. Isolated strip preparations from the outflow tract showed a concentration-dependent increase in tension in response to adrenaline, while vasoactive intestinal polypeptide caused a relaxation in adrenaline pre-contracted strip preparations. We propose that an increase in the diameter of the foramen of Panizza may be important during pulmonary to systemic shunts to allow blood to flow from the left to right aorta (reverse foramen flow) in order to supply the carotid and coronary arteries. During non-shunting conditions, a constricted foramen may prevent excess flow from the right to left aorta during diastole.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8348082596, 'avg_line_length': 678.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1017074981, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9031400084, 'max_line_length': 1254, 'num_words': 281, 'perplexity': 180.8, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1651917404, 'text_len': 1356, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.1029598484069366e+19

Size heteromorphism in C-bands was detected in pairs 7 and 10. Ag-NOR staining revealed a maximum of three nucleolar organizers. Telomeric probes hybridized only at the terminal regions of all chromosomes. Additionally, a comparison was carried out between C. hoffmannsii and C. m. moloch (2n = 48), as previously reported. Both species shared gross chromosomal similarities diverging by a single rearrangement of centric fusion/fission.

Roles of each angiotensin II producing enzymes of each of the angiotensin II-producing enzymes were reviewed based on experimental models. In vascular tissues, angiotensin II is potentially cleaved from angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase. It has been confirmed that vascular tissues of humans, monkeys, dogs and hamsters have a chymase-dependent angiotensin II-forming pathway. Much like other hypertensive models, hamster hypertensive models show high levels of vascular ACE activity, but not chymase activity. In hypertensive hamsters, administration of either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist resulted in similar reductions in blood pressure, suggesting that chymase is not involved in the maintenance of high blood pressure in this model. In monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet, ACE activity was increased in the atherosclerotic lesions, and an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor antagonist prevented atherosclerosis to a similar degree, suggesting that ACE may be mainly involved in the development of atherosclerosis. After balloon injury in dog vessels, both ACE and chymase activities were locally increased about 3-fold in the injured arteries, and an AT1 receptor antagonist was effective in preventing the intimal formation, but an ACE inhibitor was ineffective. In dog grafted veins, the activities of chymase were increased 15-fold, but those of ACE were increased only 2-fold, and the intimal formation was suppressed by either an AT1 receptor antagonist or a chymase inhibitor. In the normal vascular tissues, ACE plays a crucial role for angiotensin II production, whereas chymase is stored in mast cells in an inactive form. Chymase acquires the ability to form angiotensin II following mast cells activation followed by mast cells activation by a strong stimulus such as occurs in catheter-injury or grafting. Together, these results indicate that chymase plays a major role in the vascular angiotensin II-generating system, particularly in cases of vascular injury.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8298171589, 'avg_line_length': 1066.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0941619586, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9351549745, 'max_line_length': 2051, 'num_words': 434, 'perplexity': 250.3, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1744022504, 'text_len': 2133, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.8607337332438267e+18

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of blunted nocturnal blood pressure reduction in non-dipper hypertensive patients. We studied the diurnal variations in systemic hemodynamic indices and baroreflex sensitivity. In 45 subjects with essential hypertension (24 men; mean age, 49+/-1 years), intra-arterial pressure was monitored telemetrically. Non-dippers were defined as those with a nocturnal reduction of systolic blood pressure of less than 10% of daytime systolic blood pressure. Stroke volume was determined using Wesseling's pulse contour method, calibrated with indocyanine green dilution. Baroreflex sensitivity was calculated as deltapulse interval/deltasystolic blood pressure on spontaneous variations. The mean values of the hemodynamic parameters were calculated every 30 min. Twenty-six subjects were classified as non-dippers. Daytime blood pressure was not significantly different between dippers (149+/-4/87+/-3 mmHg) and non-dippers (147+/-3/82+/-2 mmHg), while the nighttime blood pressure was significantly reduced in dippers (131+/-3/77+/-2 mmHg) but not in non-dippers (145+/-3/80+/-2 mmHg).

Plotting of the data for Japanese women of the same age group yielded the same number of circles as the data for men.

Hemodialysis patients frequently show associated hypertension, which can lead to a number of cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of hypertension on the structure and function of the carotid artery and left ventricle (LV) in hemodialysis patients. In addition, we investigated the contribution of hemodialysis and other risk factors. Fifty-two hemodialysis patients, 71 hypertensive patients (HT group) and 30 normotensive subjects (NT group) were included in this study. Hemodialysis patients were divided into two groups: 35 patients with hypertension (HDHT group), and 17 patients without hypertension (HDNT group). We measured intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque score, end-diastolic diameter, and stiffness index beta of the carotid artery by ultrasonography, and LV mass index (LVMi), endocardial fractional shortening (FS), and midwall FS (MWS) by echocardiography. A multiple stepwise regression analysis including hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other risk factors was also performed. IMT was significantly higher in the HT and HDHT groups than in the NT group. Plaque score and diameter of the carotid artery were higher in the HDHT group than in the other three groups. The stiffness index beta was higher in the HDHT group than in the non-hemodialysis groups. In multivariate analysis, IMT was independently correlated with age and hypertension. Plaque score and stiffness index beta were independently associated with age, hypertension, and hemodialysis. LVMi was higher in HT and hemodialysis-patients groups than in the NT group. Hypertension and hemodialysis were strong and independent predictors of LVMi. FS showed no significant differences among the four groups, but MWS was significantly lower among the hemodialysis patients than in the NT group. MWS was independently correlated with hemodialysis and diabetes. In conclusion, hemodialysis per se advanced both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis of the carotid artery. Moreover, it increased LVMi and caused cardiac dysfunction. Associated hypertension might thus accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis of the carotid artery and the increase of LVMi.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8302214503, 'avg_line_length': 1151.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1194420227, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9465959668, 'max_line_length': 2213, 'num_words': 474, 'perplexity': 247.4, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1732522796, 'text_len': 2303, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0430107527}",4.180557625754093e+18

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma ligands thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have recently been reported to be anti-hypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic. We have previously shown that one of the TZDs troglitazone significantly suppressed the transcription of both thromboxane receptor (TXR) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) genes in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by activating PPAR-gamma. In the present study, we compared the effects of troglitazone and other TZDs on the transcription of these genes. TXR and AT1R mRNAs in rat VSMCs were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase chimeric constructs containing either the 989-bp rat TXR gene promoter or the 1,969-bp rat AT1R gene promoter were transiently transfected into VSMCs. The cells were incubated with troglitazone, RS-1455 (a derivative of troglitazone which does not contain the hindered phenol resembling alpha-tocopherol), pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone for 12 h before harvesting. mRNA expression levels of TXR and AT1R were significantly decreased by troglitazone in contrast to rosiglitazone. TXR gene and AT1R gene transcription was significantly suppressed by troglitazone in a dose-dependent manner, while RS-1455 was less potent. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone weakly suppressed the transcription of both genes in a manner almost similar to RS-1455. We have shown that troglitazone suppresses transcription of both the TXR and AT1R genes more potently than other TZDs. The structure of troglitazone and RS-1455 is identical except the hindered phenol, which is recently recognized to function as an antioxidant. Moreover, we have shown that the potency for activating PPAR-gamma is almost identical between troglitazone and RS-1455. We therefore speculate that the strong transcriptional suppression of the TXR and AT1R genes by troglitazone may be mediated in part by its antioxidant effect.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8349705305, 'avg_line_length': 1018.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1021213616, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9281811714, 'max_line_length': 1903, 'num_words': 462, 'perplexity': 429.4, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1836935167, 'text_len': 2036, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",2.0052714758904858e+18

Endothelin and growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 are important regulators of the cardiovascular system. Although increased production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and TGF-beta1 have been reported in left ventricular hypertrophy, the detailed roles of these substances in hypertrophy remain to be determined. To elucidate the cardioprotective effects of calcium antagonists in left ventricular hypertrophy, we evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with benidipine, a long-acting calcium antagonist, on preproET-1, ET(A) receptor (ETAR) and TGF-beta1 expression in the left ventricle and evaluated the relations between these effects and myocardial remodeling in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive (DS) rats fed a high-salt diet. After 5 weeks of feeding an 8% NaCl diet to 6-week-old DS rats (i.e., at 11 weeks of age), a distinct stage of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (DSLVH) was noted. Benidipine (DSLVH-B group, n= 8; 1 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose) or vehicle (DSLVH-V group, n=8) was administered to 6-week-old DS rats for 5 weeks, or until the onset of DSLVH stage, and age-matched (11-week-old) Dahl salt-resistant rats fed the same diet served as a control group (DR-C, n=8). Blood pressure was similar between the DSLVH-B and DSLVH-V groups, but was significantly lower in DR-C rats. The preproET-1, ETAR and TGF-beta1 expressions in the left ventricle were significantly higher in DSLVH-V than in DR-C rats, and significantly lower in DSLVH-B than in DSLVH-V. Benidipine administration resulted in significant improvements in the wall-to-lumen ratio and perivascular fibrosis in the coronary arterioles, and in myocardial fibrosis. We therefore concluded that myocardial remodeling and left ventricular hypertrophy in DS hypertensive rats fed a high-salt diet were significantly ameliorated by a subdepressor dose of benidipine, and that this amelioration was partly due to decreases in the expression of ET-1 and TGF-beta1 in the left ventricle.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8093869732, 'avg_line_length': 1044.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0870610871, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9174211621, 'max_line_length': 1993, 'num_words': 453, 'perplexity': 503.5, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2025862069, 'text_len': 2088, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",4.5941770667198653e+18

Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hypertrophy, which results in several cardiovascular diseases. Ang II-induced cellular events have been mediated, in part, by reactive oxygen species (ROS) which also involve activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Although it has been proposed that the therapeutic administration of antioxidants is useful for vascular diseases, the precise mechanisms which regulate ROS-sensitive signaling events have not been well characterized. Thus, we hypothesized that antioxidants may affect ROS-mediated MAP kinases activation induced by Ang II. The present findings showed that Ang II stimulated rapid and significant activation of ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). Ang II-induced ERK 1/2 activation was not affected by all antioxidants examined, whereas JNK was sensitive to all antioxidants. In contrast, p38 MAPK activation was inhibited by DPI and ascorbic acid concentration-dependently, but by NAC only at high concentration. DETC and Trolox C had no effects on p38 MAPK activation by Ang II. We further examined the effects of antioxidants on Ang II-induced increases in oxygen consumption as an index of ROS generation in RASMC. DPI strongly inhibited Ang II-induced increases in oxygen consumption. DETC also inhibited Ang II-induced oxygen consumption, whereas ascorbic acid markedly augmented it. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of antioxidants on MAP kinases activation in VSMC are attributable, in part, to their modulating effects on ROS generation by Ang II in VSMC. Thus, inhibition of MAP kinases by antioxidants may imply their usefulness for relief of cardiovascular diseases.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8260869565, 'avg_line_length': 931.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0916936354, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9580647945, 'max_line_length': 1734, 'num_words': 379, 'perplexity': 430.4, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1814278046, 'text_len': 1863, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.7694363946845008e+19

The present in vitro study was performed to investigate the effects of estriol (E3) on membrane fluidity of erythrocytes by means of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and spin-labeling method. E3 was shown to significantly decrease the order parameter (S) for 5-nitroxide stearate (5-NS) and the peak height ratio (ho/h-1) for 16-NS obtained from EPR spectra of erythrocyte membranes. This finding indicated that E3 might increase the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes. The effect of E3 was significantly potentiated by the nitric oxide (NO) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and a cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) analog, 8-bromo-cGMP. In contrast, the change in the membrane fluidity induced by E3 was antagonized by the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NG-nitroarginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME), and asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA). The results of the present study showed that E3 significantly increased the membrane fluidity and improved the microviscosity of erythrocyte membranes, partially mediated by an NO- and cGMP-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the data might be consistent with the hypothesis that E3 could have a beneficial effect on the rheological behavior of erythrocytes and may play a crucial role in the regulation of microcirculation.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8185028249, 'avg_line_length': 708.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.105899076, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9046247005, 'max_line_length': 1282, 'num_words': 295, 'perplexity': 199.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1920903955, 'text_len': 1416, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.4844576487234058e+18

We examined the Ca2+-buffering function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the resting state of arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at a prehypertensive stage. Differences in the effects of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin, agents that inhibit SR Ca2+-ATPase, and of ryanodine, which depletes SR Ca2+, on tension and cellular Ca2+ level were assessed in endothelium-denuded strips of femoral arteries from 4-week-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Addition of CPA, thapsigargin or ryanodine to the resting state of the strips caused an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ level and a contraction in both WKY and SHR. These responses were larger in SHR than in WKY. The contractions were inhibited strongly by 100 nM nifedipine or 3 microM verapamil and were abolished by Ca2+-free solution. Nifedipine, verapamil or Ca2+-free solution itself caused a relaxation from the resting state of SHR strips, but not from that of WKY strips. The resting Ca2+ influx in arteries measured by a 5-min incubation with 45Ca was significantly larger in SHR than in WKY. This influx was decreased by 10 microM CPA or 10 microM ryanodine in both WKY and SHR. These results suggest that in the resting state of the femoral artery from 4-week-old SHR, the greater part of the increased Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels is buffered by Ca2+ uptake into the SR, while some Ca2+ reaches the myofilaments, resulting in the maintenance of resting tone.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8116207951, 'avg_line_length': 817.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0781057811, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9533405304, 'max_line_length': 1466, 'num_words': 384, 'perplexity': 649.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2042813456, 'text_len': 1635, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",6.815999022858703e+18

Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either normal rat chow (control) or a fructose-rich chow (FFR) for 6 weeks. For the last 2 weeks of the 6-week period of either diet, the rats were treated by gavage with gum arabic solution as a vehicle (control or FFR) or JTKL (3.24 g/kg/day; FFR+JT), and then an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique was performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. Systolic blood pressure was measured each week of the 6-week period. At the end of the glucose clamp, the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were dissected out for determination of the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by an ELISA assay. Systolic blood pressures in the FFR groups were significantly higher than that in the control group, although there was no effect on systolic blood pressure for the last 2 weeks of treatment with JTKL. The average rate of glucose infusion during the glucose clamp, as an index of insulin sensitivity (M value), was significantly lower in the FFR than in the control rats, and treatment with JTKL for 2 weeks significantly increased the M value to that of control.

This study used a sub-database of the Chinese sample of the WHO-Cardiovascular Diseases and Alimentary Comparison (CARDIAC) Study. The WHO-CARDIAC Study was a multicenter cross-sectional study. In each center, 100 men and 100 women aged 48-56 years were selected at random from the local population. Various markers of dietary intake and their relation with BP were studied.

There were also significant differences in other factors, such as magnesium, 3-methylhistidine (3MH) (a biological marker of animal protein intake) and taurine (a biological marker of seafood intake) excretion levels among the four ethnic peoples. 3) In general, BMI, Na and/or Na/K ratios were positively, and 3MH/creatinine and taurine/creatinine ratios were negatively associated with BP. 4) After adjustment for age, sex and potassium, subjects with obesity (BMI > or =26 kg/m2) had significantly higher relative risk of being hypertensive (HT) than those with BMI<26 kg/m2 in the Han, Uygur and Kazak populations; and subjects with elevated sodium excretion (Na > or =244 mmol/day) had significantly higher relative risk of being HT than those with Na<244 mmol/day in the Han, Uygur and Tibetan populations. In conclusion, mean BP and prevalence rates of hypertension were significantly different among the four ethnic groups.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), candesartan, on the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in rats after I-R. Rats were divided into a control group, a candesartan group I (0.015 mg/kg), and a candesartan group II (0.03 mg/kg). Candesartan was intravenously administered 30 min before ischemia. All rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. The data showed that left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure and LV +dp/dt was decreased after administration of candesartan, but increased after reperfusion in the candesartan group II, compared with those in the candesartan group I and control group. LV -dp/dt was decreased after candesartan administration in candesartan group II. The number of apoptotic cells in the candesartan groups (497+/-204 and 543+/-254, respectively) was higher than that in the control group (287+/-166; p<0.05). There was no significant difference in infarct size among the three groups. However, plasma CPK was lower in the candesartan groups than in the control group. Northern blot analysis showed that p53 mRNA was upregulated in the candesartan groups, in association with increased expression of bax mRNA.

To document biopsychosocial profiles of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by means of the INTERMED and to correlate the results with conventional methods of disease assessment and health care utilization. Patients with RA (n = 75) were evaluated with the INTERMED, an instrument for assessing case complexity and care needs. Based on their INTERMED scores, patients were compared with regard to severity of illness, functional status, and health care utilization. In cluster analysis, a 2-cluster solution emerged, with about half of the patients characterized as complex. Complex patients scoring especially high in the psychosocial domain of the INTERMED were disabled significantly more often and took more psychotropic drugs. Although the 2 patient groups did not differ in severity of illness and functional status, complex patients rated their illness as more severe on subjective measures and on most items of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Complex patients showed increased health care utilization despite a similar biologic profile. The INTERMED identified complex patients with increased health care utilization, provided meaningful and comprehensive patient information, and proved to be easy to implement and advantageous compared with conventional methods of disease assessment.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been associated with tendinitis and tendon rupture. In this paper we report on the followup of 42 spontaneous reports of fluoroquinolone-associated tendon disorders. This study is based on cases of fluoroquinolone-associated tendon disorders reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb and the Drug Safety Unit of the Inspectorate for Health Care between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 1998. By means of a mailed questionnaire, we collected information on the site of injury, onset of symptoms, treatment, and course of the tendon disorder as well as information on possible risk factors and concomitant medication. Of 50 mailed questionnaires, 42 (84%) were returned. The data concerned 32 patients (76%) with tendinitis and 10 patients (24%) with a tendon rupture. Sixteen cases (38%) were attributed to ofloxacin, 13 (31%) to ciprofloxacin, 8 (19%) to norfloxacin, and 5 (12%) to pefloxacin. There was a male predominance, and the median age of the patients was 68 years. Most of the reports concerned the Achilles tendon, and 24 patients (57%) had bilateral tendinitis. The latency period between the start of treatment and the appearance of the first symptoms ranged from 1 to 510 days with a median of 6 days. Most patients recovered within 2 months after cessation of therapy, but 26% had not yet recovered at followup.

Prospectively collected longitudinal measures including tender joint count (JC), duration of morning stiffness (MS), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and serum creatinine (SCr) were modeled using generalized estimating equations. Survival methods were used to estimate CSA continuation time and its determinants. Of 133 patients (75% female, median RA duration 13 years), 37 discontinued CSA because of ineffectiveness (19) or because of toxicity (18) including increased SCr in 10, hypertension in 4, infections in 3, and gingival hyperplasia in 1. Patients remained on CSA a median of 75 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 38-112). Those receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX) were more than 4 times as likely to continue on CSA therapy (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.94). A lower final JC was predicted by a longer CSA treatment duration (relative risk [RR] 0.99 per month, 95% CI 0.98-0.99) and concomitant MTX therapy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99); decreased MS was predicted only by longer CSA treatment duration (reduction of 2.0 minutes per month, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Each previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) exposure predicted a rise in SCr (35 micromole/liter, 95% CI 22-48), SBP (7.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.7-11.7), and DBP (3.8 mm Hg, 95% CI 3.0-6.4).

We integrated these concepts by examining the hypothesis that satisfaction with one's abilities may explain the mechanism by which the impact of RA on valued activities leads to depression. Data were collected over 2 years (1997 and 1998) through interviews with the University of California, San Francisco, RA panel. Analyses examined whether activity impairment in 1997 predicted later (1998) dissatisfaction with abilities and depression. Greater impact on activities predicted dissatisfaction with abilities, which in turn was associated with higher depression scores. There was no direct relationship between activity impact and depression when satisfaction with abilities was considered.

The audiotaped interviews were transcribed and coded for content. Categories were linked, comparisons made, and a theory built about how people respond to the question ""Are you better?""

Being better is not only reflected in changes in the state of the disorder (resolution) but could be an adjustment of life to work around the disorder (readjustment) or an adaptation to living with the disorder (redefinition). The experience of the disorder can be influenced by factors such as the perceived legitimacy of the disorder, the comparators used to define health and illness, and coping styles, which in turn can influence being better. Two patients could mean very different things when saying that they are better.

Cross-sectional study based on interview data on two randomly sampled sequential populations consisting of 7,610 Swedish adult (25-64 years) residents and 4,315 children (3-15 years) in their households from the Survey of Living Conditions 1996-97, and 7,649 adult Swedish residents (25-64 years) from the survey of 1988-89. Low educational level, having no cash margin and being born outside of Sweden was associated with higher odds of problems with chewing, wearing a prosthesis and not having been treated by a dentist during the 24 months preceding the interview, in a logistic regression analysis of data from the 1996-97 survey in the adult study population (adjusted odds ratios 1.6-2.9). The same socio-economic determinants were associated with caries in children (adjusted odds ratios 1.2-1.5). The socio-economic differences in dental treatment and problems with chewing were greater in the age group 45-64 years compared to 25-44-year-olds. The prevalence of problems with chewing increased from 7.1% (95% CI 6.5-8.1) in the 1988-89 survey to 9.1% (8.4-9.8) in the 1996-97 survey. A similar increase, from 2.4% (2.2-2.6) to 4.4% (3.9-4.9) was observed for individuals not having been in dental treatment during the last 24 months. The socio-economic distribution of oral health and use of dental care in the adult population was similar in the two surveys. This study demonstrates that socio-economic differences in oral health and use of dental care are most marked in older (45-64 years) adults in Sweden, but are significant in young adults and, in terms of oral health, in children as well. A steep increase in user charges during the 1990s has been paralleled by a moderate increase in problems with chewing and the proportion of the population that has no regular dental care, which suggests a link that needs to be evaluated in further studies.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.7982370225, 'avg_line_length': 1021.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0875553369, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9630896449, 'max_line_length': 1975, 'num_words': 359, 'perplexity': 1538.3, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2541625857, 'text_len': 2042, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0057142857}",1.904266958045945e+17

Patient-based assessment of oral health outcomes is of growing interest. Measurement of change following clinical intervention is a key property of a health status measure. To date, most of the research on oral health status measurement has focused on construct and discriminant validity of health status measures. The objective of this study was to assess sensitivity to change of an oral-specific health status measure, the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). Study subjects were in three groups, namely, edentulous/edentate subjects who requested and received complete implant stabilised oral prostheses (IG, n=26), edentulous/edentate subjects who requested implants but received conventional dentures (CDG1, n=22), and edentulous subjects who had new conventional complete dentures (CDG2, n=35). Data were collected pre- and post-operatively using the OHIP and a validated denture satisfaction questionnaire. All subjects reported similar low levels of denture satisfaction pre-operatively. Denture problems had a more significant impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQL) for implant seekers (IG and CDG1 subjects) than subjects seeking conventional dentures (CDG2). Following treatment, significant improvement in satisfaction with oral prostheses and OHRQL was reported by IG and CDG2 subjects; the level of improvement was more moderate for CDG1 subjects. OHIP change scores were correlated with denture satisfaction change scores. It was concluded that sensitivity to change of the OHIP was good. This property was not improved by using statement weights.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8281437126, 'avg_line_length': 835.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0800722456, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9557460546, 'max_line_length': 1576, 'num_words': 311, 'perplexity': 719.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1790419162, 'text_len': 1670, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.0611997293036388e+19

The oral health of a large cohort of adult insulin-dependent diabetic patients (Type 1), diagnosed 24 years previously with juvenile onset, was comprehensively assessed. This paper describes the prevalence of coronal and root caries in this adult Type 1 diabetic population and evaluates demographic, dietary, behavioral, physiologic, salivary and medical variables associated with decayed and filled surfaces in the crown (DFS) or root (RDFS). Type 1 diabetes mellitus subjects participating in this oral health evaluation had been monitored for 6-8 years as participants in the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Epidemiology, longitudinal study of medical complications associated with diabetes. Four hundred and six diabetic subjects received a comprehensive oral health examination during one of their regularly scheduled medical visits. Oral assessments included coronal and root caries, missing teeth, edentulism, periodontal status, soft tissue pathologies, salivary function and health behaviors. Sixteen diabetic subjects and one control subject were edentulous. Coronal and root caries data from the remaining 390 dentate diabetic subjects were compared with 202 dentate nondiabetic control subjects. The adult Type 1 diabetic subjects were not found to have significantly higher DFS rates as compared with our control subjects or published age-adjusted NHANES III findings. Both control and diabetic subjects had low decayed to filled tooth surface ratios. A linear regression model evaluated possible associations with coronal decayed and filled tooth surfaces (DFS) within the diabetic population. Significant factors included older age, women, fewer missing teeth, more frequent use of dental floss, more frequent visits to the dentist during the last 12 months, and diabetic nephropathy. The prevalence of RDFS was higher in the diabetic subjects as compared to recruited control subjects. Neither dietary behaviors nor glycemic control were found to contribute to coronal or root caries. Factors associated with presence of coronal and root caries and fillings are discussed. Possible causes and implications for the association between DFS and diabetic nephropathy are provided.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8369851008, 'avg_line_length': 1141.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0928288605, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9510002136, 'max_line_length': 2201, 'num_words': 416, 'perplexity': 563.2, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1704645048, 'text_len': 2282, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",2.723659645558982e+18

The objective was to assess the prevalence, in a British population aged 65 years and older, of oral health related impacts and the effects they had on the quality of daily life and in particular on eating. 753 free living and 202 institutionalised subjects aged 65 years and over, participating in the oral health survey of the British National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), had a dental examination and interview. Data on the impact of dental and oral disorders on the activities of daily living based upon the modified Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) indicator were collected. 17% of the free living edentate participants reported that their mouth affected their pattern of daily living on a regular basis. Oral impacts levels were lowest in dentate subjects with the greatest number of teeth. For the dentate, the most common oral impacts were on eating and speaking. Impacts relating to emotional stability, sleeping, relaxing, carrying out physical activity and social contact were very infrequent, but were severe when they did occur. Among those with an impact on eating, 25% said it was severe and 42% had the impact nearly every day or in a spell of 3 or more months. Oral impacts were more prevalent among the institution sample, particularly the dentate. The impacts were associated with the inability or difficulty to eat a range of 16 common foods. This survey has shown that the oral status of older people fairly frequently affects the quality of life of older people, and in particular, the ability to eat several common types of foods.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8148148148, 'avg_line_length': 850.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0573286052, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9807258248, 'max_line_length': 1566, 'num_words': 306, 'perplexity': 513.3, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1963550852, 'text_len': 1701, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",5.169140884949079e+18

To investigate the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC) and oral health. It was hypothesised that subjects with better oral health status and better oral health-related behaviours have higher levels of SOC. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Goiânia-GO, Middle-West Brazil, on a sample of 664 15-year-olds randomly selected from schools. Data were collected through questionnaires, the short version of Antonovsky's SOC Scale (13-item) and clinical dental examinations. Multiple logistic regression and polytomous ordered regression were used in the data analysis. Two sets of outcome variables were selected for the analyses: oral health status (dental caries, oral cleanliness, and periodontal disease), and oral health-related behaviours (frequency of sugar intake, toothbrushing frequency, and pattern of dental attendance). Adolescents' SOC was associated with their caries experience in anterior teeth (OR=0.81 for 10 units increase in SOC scale; 95% CI=0.66-0.98), but the relationship did not remain significant after controlling for other factors. Adolescents with higher SOC were less likely to visit the dentist mainly when in trouble, compared with those with lower SOC (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.71-0.98), or equivalently more likely to visit for mainly check-ups. Other measures of oral health status and behaviours were not significantly associated with SOC. SOC was identified as a psychosocial determinant of adolescents' oral health-related behaviour, particularly affecting their pattern of dental attendance.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8189655172, 'avg_line_length': 812.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0978328173, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9633949995, 'max_line_length': 1535, 'num_words': 293, 'perplexity': 445.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.2001231527, 'text_len': 1624, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.2665644259411958e+19

An oral health promotion program has been conducted since 1989 at a shipyard in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of oral health promotion in the workplace in terms of dental care costs and frequency of dental visits. This program consisted of orientation, an initial regimen, and group counseling. The initial regimen included an evaluation of each participant's oral health status, and instruction concerning oral hygiene, and prevention of oral disease. The participants were selected with each unit being a preexisting peer group. Eighty-seven participants were compared with 216 control subjects in terms of annual dental care costs and frequency of dental visits in four periods: the 1-year period before the program, the 1st year after the program, the 2nd year after, and the 3rd year after. The annual mean dental care cost in the participant group for the year prior to the program was higher than that in the control group (21,317 vs. 17,116 yen). In the 1st year after the program, the difference increased (26,642 vs. 19,481 yen). In the 2nd and 3rd years after the program, dental care costs in the participant group were lower than those in the control group (2nd year: 18,305 vs. 22,841 yen, 3rd year: 16,911 vs. 21,920 yen). It can be concluded that this oral health promotion program in the workplace contributed to saving of costs associated with dental care. The workplace can be regarded as a key area for implementation of an oral health care system to make good use of limited resources.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8054216867, 'avg_line_length': 830.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.1023622047, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9664781094, 'max_line_length': 1541, 'num_words': 295, 'perplexity': 802.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.228313253, 'text_len': 1660, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.6697047775634196e+19

This paper reports the results of a study of the reliability of a modified version of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) for use in oral health surveys. Twelve non-specialist dental examiners were trained in the use of the Modified IOTN using a standardised teaching protocol lasting approximately 1.5 hours. Following a school-based calibration exercise it was found that nearly all the examiners achieved either good or excellent agreement (mean Kappa=0.74). The average sensitivity and specificity scores were 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. The Modified IOTN appears to overcome the training and reliability problems that often accompany the use of orthodontic indices by non-specialists in oral health surveys.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8265179678, 'avg_line_length': 403.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0914786967, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9489809871, 'max_line_length': 724, 'num_words': 145, 'perplexity': 574.3, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1871127633, 'text_len': 807, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",8.375489590384356e+18

Health policy makers have examined the impact of economic policies and a nation's social development on the health of its population. The purpose of this research was to investigate the association between health care expenditures, socioeconomic factors, and caries levels in 109 countries representing an array of social and economic conditions, and to determine how such factors are related to caries experience at different levels of economic development. Countries were divided into established market economies and three groups of developing nations, based on their GNP (high, medium, low income). Total health expenditures as percent GDP and as US dollars per capita, public expenditures and aid flow as percent of total health expenditures, dentists per 100,000 population, per capita sugar consumption, and urbanization of the population were compared among these countries. Correlations between these variables, and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) of 12-year-olds in these countries were assessed. The highest correlations were found between DMFT and public expenditures, sugar consumption, and urbanization. Highly significant differences emerged across nation groups by stages of development on several variables. The findings suggest that it is important to consider the stage of development of a given country when planning caries prevention policies and programs. Such a contextual approach is more likely to be successful in reducing caries levels.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8358306189, 'avg_line_length': 767.5, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0701179554, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9719367027, 'max_line_length': 1472, 'num_words': 250, 'perplexity': 289.1, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1713355049, 'text_len': 1535, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",1.2820997984247741e+18

This study compared the comfort of two bimaxillary custom-fitted mouthguards. One type was made with silicone rubber and the other with methyl-methacrylate (acrylic). The study was a within-subject crossover clinical trial with 52 high-school rugby players who were randomly allocated to one of two groups. The first group wore a silicone mouthguard for 4 months and an acrylic one for the following 4-month period. The second group wore an acrylic mouthguard followed by a silicone one for similar periods. Comfort, bulkiness, stability, hardness, ability to talk and to breathe, oral dryness, nausea and inclination to chew were evaluated for each period using a Visual Analogue Scale questionnaire. There was no significant difference concerning comfort, bulkiness, ability to talk and to breathe, oral dryness and nausea between silicone and acrylic mouthguards by group and time of examination (Three-way ANOVA P>0.05). Acrylic mouthguards were more stable and harder than silicone ones (Wilcoxon's test P<0.01). Tendency to chew was greater for silicone appliances (P<0.01). For stability, hardness and inclination to chew, there was no significant difference in the response of the players based on the sequence of use of the two types of mouthguard during the survey (Mann-Whitney test P>0.05). At the end of the study, 56% of the players preferred to keep the acrylic mouthguard and 44% chose the silicone one. This choice did not vary between the groups (chi2, P>0.05).

Microgravity has been implicated to play a role in the observed immune dysfunction of astronauts and cosmonauts after either short-term or long-term space travel. These reports, together with studies describing increased levels of microorganisms in the space cabin environment suggest potential risk for in-flight incidences of infectious diseases. In order to understand the mechanism underlying these immune defects, it is important to have a ground-based model that would reliably mimic the effects of microgravity on antigen-specific immune function. We tested the utility of the rotating wall vessel (RWV) technology developed at NASA as a model system because in the RWV the culture medium and the cells rotate synchronously with the vessel, thereby creating simulated microgravity conditions. We compared the RWV to the conventional tissue culture flask (T-flask), for culturing immune precursor cells with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against synthetic viral peptides. We observed a significant loss of antigen-specific CTL activity in RWV cultures, but not in those from the T-flask, irrespective of the peptide immunogen used for inducing the primary immune response in different mouse strains. Loss of CTL activity in RWV cultures coincided with a significant reduction in CD8+ cells as well as CD4+ cells and DEC205+ dendritic cells, suggesting adverse effects of RWV culturing on both the effector and accessory cells for the loss of antigen-specific CTL function. These results provide a strong parallel to the reported defects in cell-mediated immunity during space travel and strongly support the utility of the RWV technology as an effective ground-based model for identifying key steps in immune cell dysfunction related to microgravity.","{'alnum_ratio': 0.8345864662, 'avg_line_length': 931.0, 'char_rep_ratio': 0.0642201835, 'flagged_words_ratio': 0.0, 'lang': 'en', 'lang_score': 0.9350087047, 'max_line_length': 1764, 'num_words': 345, 'perplexity': 292.6, 'special_char_ratio': 0.1680988185, 'text_len': 1862, 'word_rep_ratio': 0.0}",9.190007824778821e+18
